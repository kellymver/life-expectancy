# life-expectancy
This project creates scatter plots using data from the United Nations Statistics Division on life expectancy. Life expectancy is compared by gender, country, and year of birth. This project was created in R Commander for practicing the ggplot package (plotting package) and dplyr and tidyr (data manipulation packages).
